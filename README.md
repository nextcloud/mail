**💌 A mail app for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)**

![](screenshots/mail.png)


## Why is this so awesome?

* **🚀 Integration with other Nextcloud apps!** Currently Contacts, Calendar & Files – more to come.
* **📥 Multiple mail accounts!** Personal and company account? No problem, and a nice unified inbox. Connect any IMAP account.
* **🔒 Send & receive encrypted mails!** Using the great [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com) browser extension.
* **🙈 We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [Horde](http://horde.org) libraries.
* **📬 Want to host your own mail server?** We don’t have to reimplement this as you could set up [Mail-in-a-Box](https://mailinabox.email)!

And in the works for the [coming versions](https://github.com/nextcloud/mail/milestones/):
* 📑 Proper grouping of message threads
* 🗄️ Folder management

## Development setup

Just clone this repo into your apps directory ([Nextcloud server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server#running-master-checkouts) installation needed). Additionally, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to fetch [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) is needed for installing JavaScript dependencies.

Once npm and Node.js are installed, PHP and JavaScript dependencies can be installed by running:
```bash
make dev-setup
```
