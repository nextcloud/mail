**💌 A mail app for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)**

## Why is this so awesome?

* **🚀 Integration with other Nextcloud apps!** Currently Contacts, Calendar & Files – more to come.
* **📥 Multiple mail accounts!** Personal and company account? No problem, and a nice unified inbox. Connect any IMAP account.
* **🔒 Send & receive encrypted mails!** Using the great [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com) browser extension.
* **📑 Message threads!** Now we have proper grouping of message threads.
* **🗄️ Mailbox management!** You can edit, delete, add submailboxes and more.
* **🙈 We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [Horde](https://www.horde.org) libraries.
* **📬 Want to host your own mail server?** We don’t have to reimplement this as you could set up [Mail-in-a-Box](https://mailinabox.email)!
