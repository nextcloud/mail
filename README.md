## Why is this so awesome?

* :rocket: **Integration with other Nextcloud apps!** Currently Contacts, Calendar & Files – more to come.
* :inbox_tray: **Multiple mail accounts!** Personal and company account? No problem, and a nice unified inbox.
* :lock: **Send & receive encrypted mails!** Using the great [Mailvelope](https://mailvelope.com) browser extension.
* :see_no_evil: **We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [Horde](http://horde.org) libraries.

And in the works for the [coming versions](https://github.com/nextcloud/mail/milestones/):
* :books: Proper grouping of message threads
* :package: Folder management
