unDraw

/license

Read below for the actual license but the gist is that you can use the 
illustrations in any project, commercial or personal without attribution or 
any costs. Just donâ€™t try to replicate unDraw, redistribute in packs the 
illustrations or create integrations for it.
a rule of thumb (tldr)

If you are working on something and want to use illustrations to improve its 
appearance, modified or not, without the need for attribution or cost, you 
are good to go. If you find unDraw or its illustrations to be in the center of 
what you are doing (e.g. sell or re-distribute one/some of them, add them in 
an app), then you probably should not proceed.
